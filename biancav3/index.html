                            At Last was an excellent read by Bianca Eugene. Eugene has a flare for writing. 
                            She draws you in from the very beginning and holds you hostage there to the very end of the story. <br /><br /><strong> ~ Urban Reviews</strong>

                            This book deserves a double star rating of 10 stars. By reading the book description, I don't think the author did this book justice with the brief description.

                            I loved how author Bianca L Eugene developed each character. She gave enough information to make you feel as if you knew the characters personally. 
                            With "At Last," there was never a dull moment. <br /><br /><strong> ~ OOSA Online Book Club </strong>
